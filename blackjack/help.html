If you are unfamiliar with the rules
of casino blackjack or simply need some clarification on the finer points, you’ve come to the right place!</p><p> I will tell you everything you need to know to play the game, and also explain the few rules that can differ from one casino
to another.</p><p> If you are new to casino table games, it can be a bit intimidating the first time that you sit down at a blackjack table.
Everything seems to move so fast, and more importantly, everyone else sure seems to know what they are doing!</p><p> Don’t worry. It’s really quite easy. Follow along, and you’ll know exactly what to expect at the table.</p><h2 id="blackjack-basics" class="header-block">Part 1 – Blackjack Basics</h2><h3 id="premise-of-the-game" class="font-light">Premise of the Game</h3><p>Blackjack is pretty simple. <strong>The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer,
without going over 21. Other players at the table are of no concern. Your hand competes only against the
hand of the dealer</strong>.</p><p>The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated, leaving no decisions up to the dealer. Therefore, there is
no problem with the dealer or any of the other players at the table seeing the cards in your hand. In fact, if
you're playing at a shoe game, the player cards are all dealt face up.</p><p>In any event, when you're just learning to play, don't hesitate to show the dealer or other players your cards and
ask questions.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="values-of-the-cards" class="font-light">Values of the Cards</h3><p>In blackjack, the cards are valued as follows:</p><ul><li> <strong>An Ace can count as either 1 or 11</strong>, as explained below.</li><li>The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.</li><li>The <strong>10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.</strong></li></ul><p> <strong>The suits of the cards do not have any meaning in the game. The value of a hand is simply the sum of the point
counts of each card in the hand.</strong> Some examples:</p><p class="text-center"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image179.png" alt="Five of Clubs"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image61.png" alt="Seven of Hearts"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image28.png" alt="Nine of Diamonds"></p><p class="text-center mB30">5 + 7 + 9 = 21, so this hand has a value of 21.</p><p class="text-center"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image37.png" alt="Jack of Diamonds"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image109.png" alt="Ten of Spades"></p><p class="text-center mB30"> 10 + 10 = 20, so this hand has a value of 20.</p><p class="text-center"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image106.png" alt="Nine of Spades"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image88.png" alt="Three of Spades"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image82.png" alt="Queen of Hearts"></p><p class="text-center mB30"> 9 + 3 + 10 = 22, so this hand is a "bust". <strong>Any hand that goes over 21 "breaks", or is "busted", and is an automatic loser.</strong></p><p>Pretty easy, eh?</p><p>The Ace adds a new twist…</p><p> <strong>An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. You need not specify which value the Ace has. It is assumed to have
the value that makes the best hand, and that may change as more cards are added to the hand.</strong></p><p class="text-center mB30"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image167.png" alt="Ace of Clubs"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image19.png" alt="Six of Diamonds"></p><p class="text-center"> This hand is valued at 7 or 17, also known as a "soft" 17.</p><p> <strong>A soft hand is any hand where an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 without going over 21. The name reflects
the fact that the hand can't break if you draw another card. It's "soft".</strong></p><p class="text-center mB30">Let's draw another card:</p><p class="text-center"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image167.png" alt="Ace of Clubs"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image19.png" alt="Six of Diamonds"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image118.png" alt="King of Spades"></p><p>Now our hand is 17, since 1 + 6 + 10 = 17. We no longer have the option to count the Ace as 11, because that would
go over 21. (This hand is now a hard 17, despite having an Ace in it.)</p><p class="text-center mB30">Let's back up, and draw a different card instead:</p><p class="text-center"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image167.png" alt="Ace of Clubs"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image19.png" alt="Six of Diamonds"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image10.png" alt="Three of Diamonds"></p><p>Now our hand is "10 or 20", a soft 20. Twenty is a great hand, so we would stop there.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="the-deal-of-the-cards" class="font-light">The Deal of the Cards</h3><p>Once all the bets are placed, the dealer will deal the cards to the players. He will make two passes around the table
starting at his left (your right) so that the players and the dealer all have two cards each. The dealer will
flip one of his cards over, exposing its value as the "dealer upcard".</p><p>(In some parts of the world, the dealer may get only one card. I'll cover that in a moment.)</p><p>In games dealt from a shoe, the players' cards will be face-up, and players are not allowed to touch the cards. If
you are just beginning, this is the best kind of game, because you don't have to worry about handling the cards.</p><div class="bji-note mB20"><p>Hand-held games are slightly different. In these games, the players' cards are dealt face down, and players pick
up the cards. When handling the cards in a hand-held game, here are a few important things to remember.</p><ul><li>You must only touch the cards with one hand. If you are a poker player, this can take some effort to break
old habits!</li><li>You must keep the cards over the table. Don't pull them close to your body.</li><li>Any cards that the dealer subsequently deals to your hand are left on the table, not added to the cards you
are holding.</li></ul></div><p>Once the initial hands are dealt, play proceeds around the table starting at the first seat to the dealer's left,
also called "first base". Each player in turn indicates to the dealer how he wishes to play the hand. (All of
those choices are explained in the next part of this series.)</p><p>After all of the players have finished their hands, the dealer will complete his hand, and then pay the winning bets
and collect the losing bets.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="how-the-dealer-plays-his-hand" class="font-light">How the Dealer Plays His Hand</h3><p>The dealer will first flip over the "hole card" to reveal his two-card starting hand. The dealer is then required
to play his hand in a very specific way, with no choices allowed.</p><p> <strong>He must draw cards until he has a total of 17 or more.</strong> The dealer has no choice in how to play the hand.
He must continue taking cards until his total is at least 17. (A slight variation of this rule is discussed below.)</p><p class="text-center mB30">Let's look at one possible dealer hand:</p><p class="text-center mB30"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image167.png" alt="Ace of Clubs"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image55.png" alt="Five of Hearts"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image22.png" alt="Seven of Diamonds"> <img class="m10" style="width:71px" src="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/content/themes/bjinfo/trainer/images/image182.png" alt="Six of Clubs"></p><p>After flipping over the hole card, the dealer's hand was (Ace, 5). That makes a hand value of 16, so he must draw
another card.</p><p>He drew a 7, making the hand value 13 (the Ace can no longer be counted as 11). With a total of 13, he must hit again.</p><p>He drew a 6, making the hand total 19. Since that is "17 or more", the dealer stops with a final total of 19.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="wins-losses-and-ties" class="font-light">Wins, Losses, and Ties</h3><p>Once the hand is over, how does the dealer decide which bets to pay, and which bets to collect?</p><p> <strong>If you draw a card that makes your hand total go over 21, your hand is a bust. That is an automatic loser. The
dealer will immediately collect your bet, and discard your hand.</strong></p><p>Assuming you did not bust, the dealer will play out his hand at the end. <strong>If he busts by going over 21, all the remaining players win their bets.</strong></p><p>If neither you nor the dealer busted, now the dealer will compare his final total to yours.</p><p>If his total is higher than yours, you lose the bet, and he will collect your bet and put the chips in his tray.</p><p>If your total is higher than his, you win the bet, and he will pay the entire amount you have bet. After he pays
you, you'll have your initial bet plus the amount you won in the circle.</p><p>So, what happens if you and the dealer tie, with the same exact total? Nothing at all. <strong>A tie is called a "push", and you do not win or lose your bet.</strong> Your chips stay in the betting circle
where you can leave them for the next hand if you want, or you can add to or remove from them as you wish before
the next hand.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="what-is-a-blackjack-or-natural" class="font-light">What is a Blackjack, or Natural?</h3><p> <strong>A blackjack, or natural, is a total of 21 in your first two cards</strong>. A blackjack is therefore an Ace and
any ten-valued card, with the additional requirement that these be your first two cards. <strong>If you split a pair of Aces for example, and then draw a ten-valued card on one of the Aces, this is not a blackjack,
but rather a total of 21.</strong></p><p>The distinction is important, because a winning blackjack pays the player at 3 to 2. A bet of $10 wins $15 if the
player draws a blackjack. A player blackjack beats any dealer total other than blackjack, including a dealer's
three or more card 21. <strong>If both a player and the dealer have blackjack, the hand is a tie or push.</strong></p><p>The dealer will usually pay your winning blackjack bet immediately when it is your turn to play. In the face down
games, this means that you should show the blackjack to the dealer at that time. Some casinos may postpone paying
the blackjack until after the hand is over if the dealer has a 10 card up and has not checked for a dealer blackjack.
Other casinos check under both 10 and Ace dealer upcards, and would therefore pay the blackjack immediately.</p><p>Regardless, when you are dealt a blackjack, turn the cards face up, and smile. It only happens about once every 21
hands, but it accounts for a lot of the fun of the game.</p><hr class="dark mB40"><h2 id="player-choices" class="header-block">Part 2 – Player Choices</h2><h3 id="hitting-and-standing" class="font-light">Hitting and Standing</h3><p>The most common decision a player must make during the game is whether to draw another card to the hand ("hit"),
or stop at the current total ("stand").</p><p>You will be required to make hand signals rather than just announcing "hit" or "stand" to the dealer. This is to
eliminate any confusion or ambiguity in what you choose, and also for the benefit of the ever-present surveillance
cameras. If you go over 21, or "bust", the dealer will collect your bet and remove your cards from the table
immediately.</p><p>How you signal your intention to the dealer depends on which style of game you are playing:</p><h3 id="hand-signals-in-the-shoe-game" class="mT30">Hand Signals in the Shoe Game</h3><p> <strong>In the face-up shoe game, you indicate that you want another card by tapping the table behind your cards with
a finger.</strong></p><p> <strong>When you decide to stand, just wave your hand in a horizontal motion over your cards.</strong></p><p>Remember that you are not allowed to touch the cards in this style of game.</p><h3 id="hand-signals-in-the-hand-held-game" class="mT30">Hand Signals in the Hand-Held Game</h3><p>In the face-down game, things are a little different. You will hold the first two cards with one hand.</p><p> <strong>To let the dealer know that you want to draw another card to your hand, scratch the table with the bottom of
your cards lightly.</strong> Watch another player at first to see how this works. The dealer will deal your
additional cards on the table in front of your bet. Leave those cards on the table, but mentally add them to
your total hand value. If you go over 21, just toss the two cards in your hand face up on the table. The dealer
will collect your bet and discard your hand.</p><p> <strong>When you decide to stand, tuck the two cards you are holding face-down under the chips in your betting circle.</strong> This can be a bit tricky the first few times. Don't pick up the bet to place the cards underneath. <strong>Remember, once the cards are dealt, you can't touch the chips in the circle.</strong> Simply slide the corner
of the cards under the chips.</p><p>Describing these moves makes them sound complicated. They're not. Just pay attention to what other players are doing
and you will fit right in.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="doubling-down" class="font-light">Doubling Down</h3><p> <strong>Much of the excitement and profit in blackjack comes from hands where you are able to "double down". This option
is available only with a two card hand, before another card has been drawn. Doubling down allows you to double
your bet and receive one (and only one) additional card to your hand.</strong></p><p>A good example of a doubling opportunity is when you hold a total of 11, like a (6,5) against a dealer's upcard of
5. In this case, you have a good chance of winning the hand by drawing one additional card, so you should increase
your bet in this advantageous situation by doubling down.</p><p>If you are playing in a hand-held game, just toss your original two cards face-up on the table in front of your bet.</p><p>In either type of game, add an additional bet to the betting circle. <strong>Place the additional bet adjacent to the original bet, not on top of it.</strong></p><p>The dealer will deal one additional card to the hand. In a shoe game, he will probably deal the card sideways to
indicate that this was a double-down. In a hand-held game, the card will be tucked face-down under your bet to
be revealed after the hand is over. Depending on what the dealer makes on his hand, it can be an exciting wait
to see that card revealed at the end!</p><p>You are allowed to double down for any amount up to your original bet amount, so you could actually double down for
less if you wanted. That's a bad move though. Remember that you do give up something for being allowed to increase
your bet: the ability to draw more than one additional card. If the correct play is to double down, you should
always double for the full amount if possible.</p><p>And just when should you double down, you ask? For that information, just use our <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-basic-strategy-engine/">Blackjack Basic Strategy Engine</a>.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="splitting-pairs" class="font-light">Splitting Pairs</h3><p> <strong>When you are dealt a pair of cards of the same rank, you are allowed to split the pair into two separate hands
and play them independently.</strong> Let's say you are dealt a pair of eights for a total of sixteen. Sixteen
is the worst possible player hand, since it is unlikely to win as is, but is very likely to bust if you draw
to it. Here's a great chance to improve a bad situation.</p><p>If you are playing a hand-held game, toss the cards face-up in front of your bet just like a double down. <strong>Then, in either type of game, place a matching bet beside the original bet in the circle. Note that you must
bet the same amount on a split, unlike a double-down where you are allowed to double for less.</strong></p><p>The dealer will separate the two cards, and treat them as two independent hands. He will deal a second card on the
first eight, and you will play that two-card hand to completion. </p><p>No matter what happens on your first hand, when you are done with it the dealer will deal a second card to your next
hand and the process starts all over.</p><h3 id="resplitting" class="mT30">Resplitting</h3><p> <strong>If you get additional pairs in the first two cards of a hand, most casinos will allow you to resplit, making
yet another hand. Typically a player is allowed to split up to 3 times, making 4 separate hands, with 4 separate
bets. If double after split is allowed, you could have up to 8 times your initial bet on the table!</strong></p><h3 id="splitting-tens" class="mT30">Splitting Tens</h3><p> <strong>Note that you are allowed to split any 10-valued cards, so you could split a (Jack, Queen) hand. However, this
is usually a bad play. Keep the 20.</strong> You will make more money on the pat 20 than you will trying
to make two good hands from it.</p><p>Not convinced? I wrote a post about just that: <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/why-splitting-tens-is-a-bad-move/">Why Splitting Tens is a Bad Move</a>.</p><h3 id="splitting-aces" class="mT30">Splitting Aces</h3><p>Another oddity comes when splitting Aces. Splitting Aces is a very strong player move so the casino limits you to
drawing only one additional card on each Ace. <strong>Also, if you draw a ten-valued card on one of your split Aces, the hand is not considered a Blackjack, but is
instead treated as a normal 21, and therefore does not collect a 3:2 payoff.</strong></p><p>Some casinos allow resplitting Aces if you draw another, but many do not.</p><p>With all these limitations, you may wonder whether it makes sense to split Aces. <br> The answer is a resounding <strong>YES</strong>. <strong>Always split Aces</strong>.</p><p>For accurate advice on what other pairs you should split, consult the <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-basic-strategy-engine/">Blackjack Basic Strategy Engine</a>.</p><hr class="dark mB40"><h2 id="basic-strategy" class="header-block">Part 3 – Basic Strategy</h2><p> If you want to win at Blackjack, you will eventually need to learn basic strategy from <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-basic-strategy-engine/">a basic strategy chart</a> or play the <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-strategy-trainer/">interactive strategy trainer</a>. However, there are some quick rules and tips that you can learn as a beginner
to decrease the house edge and formulate a strategy.</p><h3 id="when-to-hit-or-stand-in-blackjack">When to Hit or Stand in Blackjack</h3><ul><li>1: <strong>Never</strong> hit a hard 17 or above.</li><li>2: <strong>Never</strong> stand on an 11 or lower.</li><li>3: <strong>Never</strong> hit a 12-16 against a dealer 4, 5 or ,6.</li><li>3: <strong>Always</strong> hit a 12-16 against a dealer 7 or higher.</li><li>4: <strong>Always</strong> hit on soft 17 or less.</li></ul><h3 id="when-to-double-in-blackjack">When to Double in Blackjack</h3><p>Remember there are more 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K) than any other cards in the deck—so when a 10 will get you close
to 21 and you are against a card that is bad for the dealer, you should double. A player 9, 10, or 11 would always
be a good double when a dealer is showing a 3, 4, 5, or 6. This is because the 3, 4, 5, and 6 are starting cards
that are more likely to make a dealer bust.</p><ul><li>1: <strong>Always</strong> double a 9 against a 3, 4, 5, or 6.</li><li>2: <strong>Always</strong> double a 10 against any dealer card other than a 10 or Ace.</li><li>3: <strong>Always</strong> double an 11 against any dealer card other than an Ace.</li><li>3: <strong>Always</strong> double a soft 18 or below against a 5 or 6.</li></ul><h3 id="when-to-split-in-blackjack">When to Split in Blackjack</h3> <strong>1: Always split Aces and 8’s.</strong><p> The Ace is such a powerful card because pulling a 10 on a split will give you a 21. Even though a 21 gained through a split
is still only paid 1:1, it is a very advantageous situation. Splitting 8’s is important because it rids you of
a 16—the worst hand in Blackjack.</p> <strong>2: Never split Fives or Faces.</strong><p> Two fives total 10—which is a hand much better suited for doubling. Face cards or 10’s should not be split because they already
total 20, which is a great hand on its own.</p><hr class="dark mB40"><h2 id="insurance-and-surrender" class="header-block">Part 4 – Insurance and Surrender</h2><h3 id="insurance" class="font-light">Insurance</h3><p>Insurance in blackjack is often misunderstood by players, and is a big money-maker for casinos. Naming this side-bet
"insurance" was a brilliant marketing ploy, and some otherwise solid players will frequently make this bad bet
to "insure" when they have a good hand. But actually, insurance is not always a bad bet. For players who can
recognize when the remaining deck is rich in ten-valued cards, this can actually be a profitable side-bet.</p><p>So, what exactly is "insurance" in blackjack anyway?</p><p> <strong>Insurance is a proposition bet that is available only when the dealer's upcard is an Ace.</strong></p><p>When the dealer turns up an Ace, he will offer "Insurance" to the players. Insurance bets can be made by betting
up to half your original bet amount in the insurance betting stripe in front of your bet.</p><p>The dealer will check to see if he has a 10-value card underneath his Ace, and if he does have Blackjack, your winning
Insurance bet will be paid at odds of 2:1. You will still lose your original bet (unless you also have a Blackjack),
so the net effect is that you break even (assuming you bet the full half bet for insurance.) This is why the
bet is described as "insurance", since it seems to protect your original bet against a dealer blackjack. Of course,
if the dealer does not have blackjack, you'll lose the insurance bet, and still have to play the original bet
out.</p><p> <strong>Insurance is simply a side-bet offering 2:1 odds that the dealer has a 10-valued card underneath their Ace.</strong> Not surprisingly, the casino has a substantial edge on this bet. In a single deck game, there are 16 ten-valued cards. Assuming
that you don't see any other cards, including your own, the tens compose 16 out of 51 remaining cards after the
dealer's Ace was removed. For the insurance bet to be a break-even bet, the hole card would have to be a ten
1 out of 3 times, but 16/51 is only 1 in 3.1875.</p><p>That creates a 5.88% house edge on the insurance bet in single deck. It's even worse in six decks with a 7.40% house
edge.</p><p>Card counters can still beat the insurance bet, by only making the bet when they know that more than one-third of
the remaining cards are tens.</p><p>Unless you are card counter and know the deck is skewed sufficiently, just ignore the insurance bet. It doesn't matter
whether you have a good hand or a bad hand.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="taking-even-money-on-blackjack" class="font-light">Taking "Even Money" on Blackjack</h3><p>If you have a blackjack when the dealer turns up an Ace, he is likely to offer you "even money" instead of the insurance
bet. If you accept, the dealer will pay you the amount of your original bet and discard your hand of blackjack,
before he even checks under his Ace to see if he has a blackjack as well.</p><p>Many players think this sounds like a good deal, guaranteeing a profit even if the dealer has a blackjack. But that
guaranteed profit comes at a price. You will win more money in the long run by holding out for the full $15 payout
when the dealer does not have blackjack, even though you will sometimes end up empty-handed.</p><p>"Even money" is nothing but an insurance bet on your blackjack, nothing more and nothing less. Let me show you how
it works:</p><p>Let's say you bet $10, and have a Blackjack. You would normally collect $15 for this, unless the dealer also has
a blackjack in which case you push or tie. Let's assume that the dealer has an Ace up, and you decide to take
insurance for the full amount allowed of $5.</p><p>Now, two things can happen:</p><ol><li>The dealer has a Blackjack. You tie with the $10, but collect 2:1 on the $5 insurance bet for a total profit
of $10.</li><li>The dealer does not have Blackjack. You lose the $5 insurance bet, but collect $15 for your blackjack. Your total
profit is again $10.</li></ol><p>In either case, once you make the insurance bet you are guaranteed a profit of $10, which is an even money payout
for your original bet. So, casinos allow you to eliminate the insurance bet altogether, and simply declare that
you want "even money" for your blackjack when the dealer has an Ace showing.</p><p>The problem is that you are still making a bad bet on insurance, which costs you money. If you ignore the offer of
even money, sometimes you get $15, and sometimes you get $0. But on average, you will collect slightly more than
the $10 you are offered for even money.</p><p>A player who does not count cards should simply never take the insurance bet, even the "even money" variety.</p><hr class="dotted mB40"><h3 id="surrender" class="font-light">Surrender</h3><p> <strong>Some games offer the player a chance to fold their hand, and forfeit half of their bet. This surrender option
must be done as the very first action the player takes on the hand.</strong> In other words, you can't draw
a card and then decide to bail out!</p><p>Even when surrender is available, it is rarely used by players. Often, the rules posted at the table won't mention
it even if the casino allows it. And many players just don't like the idea of surrendering a hand. But for a
smart player, it is a useful option, and reduces the house advantage by about 0.08%.</p><p>When surrender is available, make sure you know the correct strategy for using it. Most players who use the option
surrender too many hands. If your game offers surrender, I recommend reading my <a href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-surrender-explained/">complete explanation of blackjack surrender</a>.</p><p>In the most common variety (known as "late" surrender), a player cannot surrender until after the dealer has checked
for blackjack. If the dealer has blackjack, you will lose your entire bet with no chance of surrendering for
            half the cost.</p></div>
